# What is Generative AI?

- Uses AI to generate novel content - text, images, audio, video, code
- Powered by large language models trained on massive datasets
- Produces original, human-like outputs based on user prompts

[Image: Diagram showing user providing a text prompt to a generative AI system, which outputs new text, images, audio matching the prompt] 

Speaker notes:
- Generative AI refers to AI systems that can create brand new content, from text to images to code, that seems like it could have been made by humans.
- The power comes from massive language models with billions of parameters, trained on huge datasets, that encapsulate knowledge about language and the world.
- With a simple text prompt, these models can now generate highly coherent, creative content across a range of formats, opening up extraordinary possibilities.

# Risks to Navigate

- Potential for misuse - deepfakes, misinformation, fraud
- Bias and fairness challenges as AI mimics human biases in data
- Job displacement in some fields even as new jobs are created
- Environmental toll of training energy-hungry AI models 
- Existential questions about the nature of creativity and knowledge

[Image: Icons representing each of the risks - a deepfake, an unbalanced scale for bias, a factory worker, a carbon footprint, a question mark]

Speaker notes:
- As transformative as generative AI will be, we must soberly consider the risks and downsides. 
- Bad actors can use this tech to generate highly convincing fake content to deceive and defraud.
- AI models trained on human data can absorb societal biases and unfairness.
- While many new jobs will be created, others will be automated, risking displacement.
- The computational power to train frontier AI models has a significant carbon footprint.
- And as machines exhibit more human-like creativity, it raises deep questions about the uniqueness of human intelligence.

# The Responsible AI Imperative

- Proactive risk assessment and mitigation 
- Transparency about AI usage and capabilities
- Ongoing monitoring for fairness and anomalies
- "Human in the loop" oversight for high stakes use cases
- Strategies for workforce transition as automation increases

[Image: Diagram showing a "responsible AI" framework covering each listed area]

Speaker notes: 
- To fully realize the benefits of generative AI while minimizing harms, organizations must prioritize responsible development and deployment.
- This starts with rigorously assessing risks up front and putting safeguards in place, not as an afterthought.
- Companies must be transparent with stakeholders about how and where AI is being used.
- Ongoing monitoring is needed to quickly surface problems related to bias, safety or strange model behaviors.
- For high stakes decisions, a human should stay in the loop to oversee and override the AI as needed.
- And proactive strategies will be needed to transition and reskill workers as AI automates certain tasks.
